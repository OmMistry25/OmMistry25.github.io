## Notifications:

- Mobile notifications sent through apps are one of the most powerful tools that any company can leverage to draw the attention of their desired users (of course after once they have downloaded the app).
- Notification is the only way you can keep reminding all your users that your app exists.
- The character limit for an Android push notification is 65 characters for the title and 240 characters for the description
- The character limit for an iOS push notification is 178 characters, which allows for four lines of text.
